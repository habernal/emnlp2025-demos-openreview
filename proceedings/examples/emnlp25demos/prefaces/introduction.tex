Welcome to the proceedings of the system demonstrations session of the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, held in Suzhou, China on November 4--9, 2025.
\bigskip

The system demonstrations session includes papers describing systems ranging from early research prototypes to mature production-ready software. We put particular emphasis on publicly available open-source or open-access systems. Out of 211 submissions in total, four were desk-rejected, and another five had been withdrawn by the authors. The remaining papers were reviewed by a team of over 150 reviewers (out of 343 originally invited) and the final recommendations were proposed by a team of 31 area chairs. We finally accepted 77 papers to be included in the proceedings, resulting in a 38\% acceptance rate.
\bigskip

We would like to deeply thank all the authors, area chairs, and reviewers.
