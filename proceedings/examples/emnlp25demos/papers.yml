- abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Reinforcement Learning from
    Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
    significantly improve the alignment of human-AI values and further raise the upper
    bound of AI capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive, long-context Chain-of-Thought
    (long-CoT) tasks. However, existing RLHF (or RLVR) frameworks commonly face challenges
    such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, restricting their accessibility
    for newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{OpenRLHF}, a user-friendly,
    scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed,
    and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure,
    and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners.
    Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency
    with speedups ranging from 1.22× to 1.68× across different model sizes compared
    to state-of-the-art frameworks, while requiring significantly fewer lines of code
    for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF},
    and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research
    and learning.

  title: 'EasyDistill: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Effective Knowledge Distillation
    of Large Language Models'
- abstract: "Feature attribution methods, such as SHAP and LIME, explain machine learning\
    \ model predictions by quantifying the influence of each input component. \nWhen\
    \ applying feature attributions to explain language models, a basic question is\
    \ defining the interpretable components.\nTraditional feature attribution methods,\
    \ commonly treat individual words as atomic units.\nThis is highly computationally\
    \ inefficient for long-form text and fails to capture semantic information that\
    \ spans multiple words.\nTo address this, we present CafGa, an interactive tool\
    \ for generating and evaluating feature attribution explanations at customizable\
    \ granularities. \nCafGa supports customized segmentation with user interaction\
    \ and visualizes the deletion and insertion curves for explanation assessments.\
    \ \nThrough a user study involving participants of various expertise, we confirm\
    \ CafGa's usefulness, particularly among LLM practitioners. \nExplanations created\
    \ using CafGa were also perceived as more useful compared to those generated by\
    \ two fully automatic baseline methods: PartitionSHAP and MExGen, suggesting the\
    \ effectiveness of the system."

  title: 'CafGa: Customizing Feature Attributions to Explain Language Models'
- abstract: In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, organizations are turning
    to AI agents to automate tasks, streamline business operations, and improve decision-making
    processes. However, despite the flexibility offered by existing libraries, the
    developed agents often struggle with integration into organizational workflows,
    resulting in limited daily usage for work. In this paper, we present SlackAgents,
    a multi-agent library for scalable management and collaboration of AI agents on
    Slack. As an agentic layer developed upon the Slack platform, the framework offers
    instant AI integration into organizational workflows and enables AI-powered automation
    of real daily tasks. Furthermore, SLACKAGENTS facilitates scalable collaboration,
    allowing for effective communication and task orchestration. Our solution bridges
    existing gaps, offering a robust platform for developing, deploying and managing
    AI agents for workplace environments.

  title: 'SlackAgents: Scalable Collaboration of AI Agents in Workspaces'
- abstract: 'Pre-hospital Emergency Care (PEC) systems are critical for managing life-threatening
    emergencies where rapid intervention can significantly impact patient outcomes.
    The rising global demand for PEC services, coupled with increased emergency calls
    and strained emergency departments, necessitates efficient resource utilization
    through Telephone Triage (TT) systems. However, existing TT processes face challenges
    such as incomplete data collection, communication barriers, and manual errors,
    leading to high over-triage and under-triage rates. This study proposes InTriage,
    an AI-driven multilingual TT system to provide decision support for triage. InTriage
    enhances accuracy by transcribing emergency calls, extracting critical patient
    information, prompting supplementary, and providing real-time triage decisions
    support.  We conducted an evaluation on a real-world corpus of approximately 40
    hours of telephone data, achieving a word error rate of 14.57% for speech recognition
    and an F1 score of 73.34% for key information extraction.

    By improving communication efficiency and reducing triage errors, InTriage offers
    a scalable solution to potentially help address the growing demands on PEC systems
    globally.'

  title: 'InTriage: Intelligent Telephone Triage in Pre-Hospital Emergency Care'
- abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable
    plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors.
    EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety,
    sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features.
    Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed
    for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector
    generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and
    application of steering vectors to influence the model’s behavior without modifying
    its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use—users
    do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can
    effectively guide and adjust the model’s responses, making precise control both
    accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across
    different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released
    the source code on https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration
    notebook. In addition, we provide an online system at http://easyedit.zjukg.cn/

    for real-time model steering, and a demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkfoiPfp5rQ.'

  title: 'EasyEdit2: An Easy-to-use Steering Framework for Editing Large Language
    Models'
- abstract: Explainability in automated student answer scoring systems is critical
    for building trust and enhancing usability among educators. Yet, generating high-quality
    assessment rationales remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated data
    and the prohibitive cost of manual verification, prompting heavy reliance on rationales
    produced by large language models (LLMs), which are often noisy and unreliable.
    To address these limitations, we present AERA Chat, an interactive visualization
    platform designed for automated explainable student answer assessment. AERA Chat
    leverages multiple LLMs to concurrently score student answers and generate explanatory
    rationales, offering innovative visualization features that highlight critical
    answer components and rationale justifications. The platform also incorporates
    intuitive annotation and evaluation tools, supporting educators in marking tasks
    and researchers in evaluating rationale quality from different models. We demonstrate
    the effectiveness of our platform through evaluations of multiple rationale-generation
    methods on several datasets, showcasing its capability for facilitating robust
    rationale evaluation and comparative analysis.

  title: 'AERA Chat: An Interactive Platform for Automated Explainable Student Answer
    Assessment'
- abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information
    from textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
    involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information preservation,
    where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact the text's utility
    for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of text anonymization
    proves challenging from both privacy and utility perspectives, as there is no
    universal benchmark that can comprehensively assess anonymization techniques across
    diverse, and sometimes contradictory contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source
    framework for benchmarking text anonymization methods through the lens of privacy
    and utility task sensitivity. A Python library, code, documentation and tutorials
    are publicly available.

  title: 'Tau-Eval: A Unified Evaluation Framework for Useful and Private Text Anonymization'
- abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
    concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
    context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional archival
    search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly accessible,
    and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time investments and
    specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable insights related to
    R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on published literature
    and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we present SpiritRAG, an interactive
    Question Answering (Q\&A) system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
    Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN) resolution documents related to R/S in the
    domains of health and education, SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers
    to conduct complex, context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets
    using an easily accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight
    to deploy and leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source
    material. A pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed
    questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

  title: 'SpiritRAG: A Q&A System for Religion and Spirituality in the United Nations
    Archive'
- abstract: The paper presents KMatrix-2, an open-source toolkit that supports comprehensive
    heterogeneous knowledge collaborative enhancement for Large Language Models (LLMs).
    As the successor of KMatrix, our toolkit offers powerful modular components and
    typical enhancement patterns for convenient construction of mainstream knowledge-enhanced
    LLMs systems. Besides, it provides uniﬁed knowledge integration and joint knowledge
    retrieval methods to achieve more comprehensive heterogeneous knowledge collaborative
    enhancement. Compared with KMatrix which mainly focuses on descriptive knowledge,
    this work additionally considers procedural knowledge. Moreover, systematic inter-context
    and context-memory knowledge conflict resolution methods are offered for better
    knowledge integration. Some key research questions in heterogeneous knowledge-enhanced
    Large Language Models systems are analyzed, and our toolkit's capability in building
    such systems is validated.

  title: 'KMatrix-2: A Comprehensive Heterogeneous Knowledge Collaborative Enhancement
    Toolkit for Large Language Model'
- abstract: 'Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating
    large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address
    complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow
    configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization.
    In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified
    framework. In this paper, we present **EvoAgentX**, an open-source platform that
    automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent
    workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers:
    the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
    within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms,
    TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations,
    and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for
    multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively,
    and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show
    that \method{} consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including
    a 7.44\% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00\% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00\%
    gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00\%
    on GAIA. The source code is available at: https://github.com/EvoAgentX/EvoAgentX.'

  title: 'EvoAgentX: An Automated Framework for Evolving Agentic Workflows'
- abstract: 'Current deep-research agents run in a ''''fire-and-forget'''' mode: once
    started, they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution.
    We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
    human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
    A hierarchical Planner–Executor writes every step to a live ''''plan-as-document,''''
    and a fast communication layer streams each action, file change, and tool call
    to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the run, edit the plan or
    code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted
    and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves
    state-of-the-art results on the GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI''s
    DeepResearch and Manus. These results show that strong automated performance and
    fine-grained human control can coexist. We will release the full code, protocol,
    and evaluation scripts to encourage further work on safe and controllable research
    agents upon acceptance.'

  title: 'ResearStudio: A Human-intervenable Framework for Building Controllable Deep
    Research Agents'
- abstract: 'We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
    documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are limited
    to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances beyond these
    limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken content that closely
    mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this integration, PresentAgent employs
    a modular pipeline that systematically segments the input document, plans and
    renders slide-style visual frames, generates contextual spoken narration with
    large language models and Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final
    video with precise audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating
    such multimodal outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework
    powered by Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three
    critical dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
    through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated dataset
    of 30 document–presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent approaches human-level
    quality across all evaluation metrics. These results highlight the significant
    potential of controllable multimodal agents in transforming static textual materials
    into dynamic, effective, and accessible presentation formats.'

  title: 'PresentAgent: Multimodal Agent for Presentation Video Generation'
- abstract: Language barriers in scientific documents hinder the diffusion and development
    of science and technologies. However, prior efforts in translating such documents
    largely overlooked the information in layouts. To bridge the gap, we introduce
    PDFMathTranslate, the world's first open-source software for translating scientific
    documents while preserving layouts. Leveraging the most recent advances in large
    language models and precise layout detection, we contribute to the community with
    key improvements in precision, flexibility, and efficiency. The work is open-sourced
    at https://github.com/byaidu/pdfmathtranslate with more than 222k downloads.

  title: 'PDFMathTranslate: Scientific Document Translation Preserving Layouts'
- abstract: In this work, we present PoliCorp, a web portal designed to facilitate
    the search and analysis of political text corpora. PoliCorp provides researchers
    with access to rich textual data, enabling in-depth analysis of parliamentary
    discourse over time.  The platform currently contains a collection of transcripts
    of debates from the German parliament, spanning 76 years of proceedings. With
    the advanced search functionality, researchers can apply logical operations to
    combine or exclude search criteria, making it easier to filter through vast amounts
    of parliamentary debate data. The search can be customised by combining multiple
    fields and applying logical operators to uncover complex patterns and insights
    within the data. Additional data processing steps were performed to enable web-based
    search and incorporate supplementary features. A key feature that differentiates
    PoliCorp is its intuitive web-based interface that enables users to query processed
    political texts without requiring programming skills. The user-friendly platform
    allows the creation of custom subcorpora via search parameters, which can be freely
    downloaded in JSON format for further analysis.

  title: 'Open Political Corpora: Structuring, Searching, and Analyzing Political
    Text Collections with PoliCorp'
- abstract: 'Autoregressive models dominate text generation but suffer from left-to-right
    decoding constraints that limit efficiency and bidirectional reasoning. Diffusion-based
    models offer a flexible alternative but face challenges in adapting to discrete
    text efficiently. We propose LAD (LoRA-Adapted Diffusion), a framework for non-autoregressive
    generation that adapts LLaMA models for iterative, bidirectional sequence refinement
    using LoRA adapters. LAD employs a structural denoising objective combining masking
    with text perturbations (swaps, duplications and span shifts), enabling full sequence
    editing during generation. We aim to demonstrate that LAD could be a viable and
    efficient alternative to training diffusion models from scratch, by providing
    both validation results as well as two interactive demos directly available online:

  title: 'LAD: LoRA-Adapted Diffusion'
- abstract: This work introduces UnityAI-Guard, a framework for binary toxicity classification
    targeting low-resource Indian languages. While existing systems predominantly
    cater to high-resource languages, UnityAI-Guard addresses this critical gap by
    developing state-of-the-art models for identifying toxic content across diverse
    Brahmic/Indic scripts. Our approach achieves an impressive average F1-score of
    84.23% across seven languages, leveraging a dataset of 567k training instances
    and 30k manually verified test instances. By advancing multilingual content moderation
    for linguistically diverse regions, UnityAI-Guard also provides public API access
    to foster broader adoption and application.

  title: 'UnityAI Guard: Pioneering Toxicity Detection Across Low-Resource Indian
    Languages'
- abstract: High-quality annotated data is a cornerstone of modern Natural Language
    Processing (NLP). While recent methods begin to leverage diverse annotation sources—including
    Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and human experts—they
    often focus narrowly on the labeling step itself. A critical gap remains in the
    holistic process control required to manage these sources dynamically, addressing
    complex scheduling and quality-cost trade-offs in a unified manner. Inspired by
    real-world crowdsourcing companies, we introduce CrowdAgent, a multi-agent system
    that provides end-to-end process control by integrating task assignment, data
    annotation, and quality/cost management. It implements a novel methodology that
    rationally assigns tasks, enabling LLMs, SLMs, and human experts to advance synergistically
    in a collaborative annotation workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrowdAgent
    through extensive experiments on six diverse multimodal classification tasks.
    The source code and video demo are available at https://github.com/QMMMS/CrowdAgent.

  title: 'CrowdAgent: Multi-Agent Managed Multi-Source Annotation System'
- abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but
    often fail to address localisation and low-resource variants—creating safety gaps
    in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large
    LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute.  We present LionGuard 2,
    a lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore context,
    supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on pre-trained OpenAI
    embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2 outperforms several
    commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks, including both Singapore-specific
    and public English datasets. The system is actively deployed within the Singapore
    Government, demonstrating practical efficacy at scale. Our findings show that
    high-quality local data and robust multilingual embeddings can achieve strong
    moderation performance, without fine-tuning large models. We release our model
    weights and part of our training data to support future work on LLM safety.

  title: 'LionGuard 2: Building Lightweight, Data-Efficient & Localised Multilingual
    Content Moderators'
- abstract: "Building language models (LMs), especially small and medium ones, remains\
    \ more art than science. While large LMs often improve by sheer scale, it is still\
    \ unclear why many design choices work. For small LMs, this uncertainty is more\
    \ limiting: tight parameter budgets make each decision critical, yet researchers\
    \ still lack systematic, scientific ways to test and refine new ideas. \n\nWe\
    \ introduce Pico, a lightweight, modular framework that enables systematic, hypothesis-driven\
    \ research for small and medium-scale language model development. Pico consists\
    \ of two libraries that together provide a practical sandbox where researchers\
    \ can make targeted changes to a model's architecture or training procedures and\
    \ directly observe their effects on the model's behavior. To support reproducible\
    \ experimentation, we also release a suite of baseline models, pico-decoder, trained\
    \ under standardized conditions and open-sourced for the community. Case studies\
    \ highlight how Pico can support iterative small LM design and analysis."

  title: 'Pico: A Modular Framework for Hypothesis-Driven Small Language Model Research'
- abstract: Languages vary along a wide variety of dimensions. In Natural Language
    Processing (NLP), it is useful to know how ``distant'' languages are from each
    other, so that we can inform NLP models about these differences or predict good
    transfer languages. Furthermore, it can  inform us about how diverse  language
    samples are. However, there are many different perspectives on how distances across
    languages could be measured, and previous work has predominantly focused on either
    intuition or a single type of distance, like genealogical or typological distance.
    Therefore, we propose DistaLs, a toolkit that is designed to provide users with
    easy access to a wide variety of language distance measures. We also propose a
    filtered subset, which contains less redundant and more reliable features. DistaLs
    is designed to be accessible for a variety of use cases, and offers a Python,
    CLI, and web interface. It is easily updateable, and available as a pip package.  Finally,
    we provide a case-study in which we use DistaLs to measure correlations of distance
    measures with performance on four different morphosyntactic tasks.

  title: 'DistaLs: a Comprehensive Collection of Language Distance Measures'
- abstract: Autoformalization serves a crucial role in connecting natural language
    and formal reasoning. This paper presents MASA, a novel framework for building
    multi-agent systems for autoformalization driven by Large Language Models (LLMs).
    MASA leverages collaborative agents to convert natural language statements into
    their formal representations. The architecture of MASA is designed with a strong
    emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and extensibility, allowing seamless integration
    of new agents and tools to adapt to a fast-evolving field. We showcase the effectiveness
    of MASA through use cases on real-world mathematical definitions and experiments
    on formal mathematics datasets. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent
    systems powered by the interaction of LLMs and theorem provers in enhancing the
    efficiency and reliability of autoformalization, providing valuable insights and
    support for researchers and practitioners in the field.

  title: 'MASA: LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems for Autoformalization'
- abstract: 'We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
    of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
    synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
    the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
    in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
    consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its utility
    in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of privacy leakage,
    general distributional differences from the source text, and qualitative feedback
    from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct evaluations along all
    of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload or generate using the
    toolkit''s generation module. While our toolkit can be run over any data, we highlight
    its functionality and effectiveness over datasets from two high-stakes domains:
    healthcare and law. By consolidating and standardizing evaluation metrics, we
    aim to improve the viability of synthetic text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation
    in AI development.'

- abstract: \emph{LLM-based Interactive Drama} introduces a novel dialogue scenario
    in which the player immerses into a character and engages in a dramatic story
    by interacting with LLM agents. Despite the fact that this emerging area holds
    significant promise, it remains largely underexplored due to the lack of a well-designed
    playground to develop a complete drama. This makes a significant barrier for researchers
    to replicate, extend, and study such systems. Hence, we present \textsc{Open-Theatre},
    the first open-source toolkit for experiencing and customizing LLM-based interactive
    drama. It refines prior work with an efficient multi-agent architecture and a
    hierarchical retrieval-based memory system, designed to enhance narrative coherence
    and realistic long-term behavior in complex interactions. In addition, we provide
    a highly configurable pipeline, making it easy for researchers to develop and
    optimize new approaches.

  title: 'Open-Theatre: An Open-Source Toolkit for LLM-based Interactive Drama'
- abstract: Automatic dubbing (AD) aims to replace the original speech in a video
    with translated speech that maintains precise temporal alignment (isochrony).
    Achieving natural synchronization between dubbed speech and visual content remains
    challenging due to variations in speech durations across languages. To address
    this, we propose an end-to-end AD framework that leverages large language models
    (LLMs) to integrate translation and timing control seamlessly. At the core of
    our framework lies Duration-based Translation (DT), a method that dynamically
    predicts the optimal phoneme count based on source speech duration and iteratively
    adjusts the translation length accordingly. Our experiments on English, Spanish,
    and Korean language pairs demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
    speech overlap—achieving up to 24% relative gains compared to translations without
    explicit length constraints—while maintaining competitive translation quality
    measured by COMET scores. Furthermore, our framework does not require language-specific
    tuning, ensuring practicality for multilingual dubbing scenarios.

  title: End-to-End Multilingual Automatic Dubbing via Duration-based Translation
    with Large Language Models
- abstract: 'Sanskrit Voyager is a web application for searching, reading, and analyzing
    the texts in the Sanskrit literary corpus. Unlike previous tools that require
    expert linguistic knowledge or manual normalization, Sanskrit Voyager enables
    users to search for words and phrases as they actually appear in texts, handling
    inflection, sandhi, and compound forms automatically while supporting any transliteration.
    The system integrates four core functionalities: (1) multi-dictionary lookup with
    morphological analysis and inflection tables; (2) real-time text parsing and annotation;
    (3) an interactive reader for over 900 digitalized texts; and (4) advanced corpus
    search with fuzzy matching and filtering. Evaluation shows over 92\% parsing accuracy

  title: 'AutoIntent: AutoML for Text Classification'
- abstract: "Political pledges reflect candidates' policy commitments, but tracking\
    \ their fulfilment requires reasoning over incremental evidence distributed across\
    \ multiple, dynamically updated sources. \nExisting methods simplify this task\
    \ into a document classification task, overlooking its dynamic temporal and multi-document\
    \ nature. \nTo address this issue, we introduce \\textsc{PledgeTracker}, a system\
    \ that reformulates pledge verification into structured event timeline construction.\
    \ \nPledgeTracker consists of three core components: (1) a multi-step evidence\
    \ retrieval module; (2) a timeline construction module and; (3) a fulfilment filtering\
    \ module, allowing the capture of the evolving nature of pledge fulfilment and\
    \ producing interpretable and structured timelines. \nWe evaluate PledgeTracker\
    \ in collaboration with professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating\
    \ its effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification\
    \ effort."

  title: 'PledgeTracker: A System for Monitoring the Fulfilment of Pledges'
- abstract: BRAT is a widely used web-based text annotation tool. However, it lacks
    robust Python support for effective annotation management and processing. We present
    Bratly, an open-source extension of BRAT that introduces a solid Python backend,
    enabling advanced functionalities such as annotation typings, collection typings
    with statistical insights, corpus and annotation handling, object modifications,
    and entity-level evaluation based on MUC-5 standards. These enhancements streamline
    annotation workflows, improve usability, and facilitate high-quality NLP research.
    This paper outlines the system's architecture, functionalities and evaluation,
    positioning it as a valuable BRAT extension for its users. The tool is open-source,
    and the NLP community is welcome to suggest improvements.

  title: 'Bratly: A Python Extension for BRAT Functionalities'
- abstract: We present SciClaims, an interactive web-based system for end-to-end scientific
    claim analysis in the biomedical domain. Designed for high-stakes use cases such
    as systematic literature reviews and patent validation, SciClaims extracts claims
    from text, retrieves relevant evidence from PubMed, and verifies their veracity.
    The system features a user-friendly interface where users can input scientific
    text and view extracted claims, predictions, supporting or refuting evidence,
    and justifications in natural language. Unlike prior approaches, SciClaims seamlessly
    integrates the entire scientific claim analysis process using a single large language
    model, without requiring additional fine-tuning. SciClaims is optimized to run
    efficiently on a single GPU and is publicly available for live interaction.

  title: 'SciClaims: An End-to-End Generative System for Biomedical Claim Analysis'
- abstract: We introduce LINGCONV, an interactive toolkit for paraphrase generation
    enabling finegrained control over 40 specific lexical, syntactic, and discourse
    linguistic attributes. Users can directly manipulate target attributes using sliders,
    and with automatic imputation for unspecified attributes, simplifying the control
    process. Our adaptive Quality Control mechanism employs iterative refinement guided
    by line search to precisely steer the generation towards target attributes while
    preserving semantic meaning, overcoming limitations associated with fixed control
    strengths. Applications of LINGCONV include enhancing text accessibility by adjusting
    complexity for different literacy levels, enabling personalized communication
    through style adaptation, providing a valuable tool for linguistics and NLP research,
    and facilitating second language learning by tailoring text complexity. The system
    is available at https://mohdelgaar-lingconv.hf.space, with a demo video at https://youtu.be/wRBJEJ6EALQ.

  title: 'LingConv: An Interactive Toolkit for Controlled Paraphrase Generation with
    Linguistic Attribute Control'
- abstract: 'We present BAREC Demo, a web-based system for fine-grained, sentence-level
    Arabic readability assessment. The demo is part of the Balanced Arabic Readability
    Evaluation Corpus (BAREC) project, which manually annotated 69,000 sentences (over
    one million words) from diverse genres and domains using a 19-level readability
    scale inspired by the Taha/Arabi21 framework, covering reading abilities from
    kindergarten to postgraduate levels. The project also developed models for automatic
    readability assessment.

    The demo provides two main functionalities for educators, content creators, language
    learners, and researchers: (1) a Search interface to explore the annotated dataset
    for text selection and resource development, and (2) an Analyze interface, which
    uses trained models to assign detailed readability labels to Arabic texts at the
    sentence level.

    The system and all of its resources are accessible at  https://barec.camel-lab.com.'

  title: 'BAREC Demo: Resources and Tools for Sentence-level Arabic Readability Assessment'
- abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language
    model training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing
    tools are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration
    effort, making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
    maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
    interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight, in-training
    analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including features probing,
    intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output diagnostics. It integrates
    with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus generator that provides structured
    annotations for precise evaluation of linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments
    with autoregressive transformers demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental
    phenomena such as early syntactic emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and
    representational compression, signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics
    such as loss or accuracy. With minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise
    diagnostics, convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors,
    making transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

  title: 'TRACE: Training and Inference-Time Interpretability Analysis for Language
    Models'
- abstract: We present a synthetic data generation tool integrated into EvalAssist.
    EvalAssist is a web-based application designed to assist human-centered evaluation
    of language model outputs by allowing users to refine LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation
    criteria. The synthetic data generation tool in EvalAssist is tailored for evaluation
    contexts and informed by findings from user studies with AI practitioners. Participants
    identified key pain points in current workflows including circularity risks (where
    models are judged by criteria derived by themselves), compounded bias (amplification
    of biases across multiple stages of a pipeline), and poor support for edge cases,
    and expressed a strong preference for real-world grounding and fine-grained control.
    In response, our tool supports flexible prompting, RAG-based grounding, persona
    diversity, and iterative generation workflows. We also incorporate features for
    quality assurance and edge case discovery.

  title: 'Synthetic Data for Evaluation: Supporting LLM-as-a-Judge Workflows with
    EvalAssist'
- abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) inevitably produce untruthful
    responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
    especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
    make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
    an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness prediction
    methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing toolkits such as
    Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded verification, or LM-Polygraph,
    which is limited to uncertainty-based methods, TruthTorchLM offers a broad and
    extensible collection of techniques. These methods span diverse trade-offs in
    computational cost, access level (e.g., black-box vs. white-box), grounding document
    requirements, and supervision type (self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM
    is seamlessly compatible with both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for
    locally hosted and API-based models. It also provides a unified interface for
    generation, evaluation, calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along
    with a flexible framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct
    an evaluation of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K,
    and FactScore-Bio.

  title: 'TruthTorchLM: A Comprehensive Library for Predicting Truthfulness in LLM
    Outputs'
- abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on general-purpose
    tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains challenging due to the scarcity
    of high-quality domain data. Existing data synthesis tools often struggle to extract
    reliable fine-tuning data from heterogeneous documents effectively. To address
    this limitation, we propose Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing
    fine-tuning data from unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface
    (GUI). Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
    models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text chunks.
    It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate diverse question-answer
    pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the pipeline, a human-in-the-loop
    visual interface facilitates the review and refinement of intermediate outputs
    to ensure data quality. Experiments on a financial question-answering task show
    that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized dataset significantly improves domain-specific
    performance while preserving general knowledge. The source code and installable
    package are available at https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset and have garnered
    over 10,000 GitHub stars.

  title: 'Easy Dataset: A Unified and Extensible Framework for Synthesizing LLM Fine-Tuning
    Data from Unstructured Documents'
- abstract: We present the iRead4Skills Intelligent Complexity Analyzer, an open-access
    platform specifically designed to assist educators and content developers in addressing
    the needs of low-literacy adults by analyzing and diagnosing text complexity.
    This multilingual system integrates a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    components to assess input texts along multiple levels of granularity and linguistic
    dimensions in Portuguese, Spanish, and French. It assigns four tailored difficulty
    levels using state-of-the-art models, and introduces four diagnostic yardsticks—textual
    structure, lexicon, syntax, and semantics—offering users actionable feedback on
    specific dimensions of textual complexity. Each component of the system is supported
    by experiments comparing alternative models on manually annotated data.

  title: 'TokenSmith: Streamlining Data Editing, Search, and Inspection for Large-Scale
    Language Model Training and Interpretability'
- abstract: 'Argument(ation) mining (AM) is the automated process of identification
    and extraction of argumentative structures in natural language. This field has
    seen rapid advancements, offering powerful tools to analyze and interpret complex
    and large discourse in diverse domains (political debates, medical reports, etc.).
    In this paper we introduce an AM-boosted version of BCause, a large-scale deliberation
    platform.

    The system enables the extraction and analysis of arguments from online discussions
    in the context of deliberative democracy, which aims to enhance the understanding
    and accessibility of structured argumentation in large-scale deliberation processes.'

  title: 'AM4DSP: Argumentation Mining in Structured Decentralized Discussion Platforms
    for Deliberative Democracy'
- abstract: Information extraction (IE) is fundamental to numerous NLP applications,
    yet existing solutions often require specialized models for different tasks or
    rely on computationally expensive large language models. We present GLiNER2, a
    unified framework that enhances the original GLiNER architecture to support named
    entity recognition, text classification, and hierarchical structured data extraction
    within a single efficient model. Built on a fine-tuned encoder architecture, GLiNER2
    maintains CPU efficiency and compact size while introducing multi-task composition
    through an intuitive schema-based interface. Our experiments demonstrate competitive
    performance across diverse IE tasks with substantial improvements in deployment
    accessibility compared to LLM-based alternatives. We release GLiNER2 as an open-source
    library available through pip, complete with pre-trained models and comprehensive
    documentation.

  title: 'GLiNER2: Schema-Driven Multi-Task Learning for Structured Information Extraction'
- abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement
    of over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's support
    or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris Agreement's
    goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Although InfluenceMap has made progress
    with automating key elements of the analytical workflow, a significant portion
    of the assessment remains manual, making it time- and labor-intensive and susceptible
    to human error. We propose an AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring
    of corporate climate policy engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    to automate the most time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale
    textual data. Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing,
    the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
    in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
    We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence
    extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a human-in-the-loop
    approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces, expert judgment
    to ensure accuracy.

  title: 'Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement:
    A Multilingual RAG Approach'
- abstract: While machine translation has taken great strides in recent years, thanks
    in large part to transformer language models, machine translation tools are designed
    primarily for plain text, and thus not equipped to deal with complex markup documents.
    Not even Large Language Models can reliably handle LaTeX source files, as non-standard
    structures are not captured by any available training data. Previous attempts
    to create translation engines for LaTeX either work on compiled documents, rely
    on document pre-processors which may lose critical semantic elements, or cannot
    distinguish between text and non-text content. In this paper we present LaTeXMT,
    a software solution for structure-preserving, source-to-source translation of
    LaTeX documents. All of the source code to LaTeXMT is provided under the LGPL-3.0
    open-source licence and a web version is publicly available.

  title: 'LaTeXMT: Machine Translation for LaTeX Documents'
- abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective
    intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current frameworks
    for MAD are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide
    limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms,
    and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models),
    an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM
    offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas
    (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning),
    (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g.,
    Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate.
    Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Hugging Face dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro,
    WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations.
    MALLM enables researchers to systematically configure, run, and evaluate debates
    for their problems, facilitating the understanding of the components and their
    interplay.

  title: 'MALLM: Multi-Agent Large Language Models Framework'
- abstract: We introduce RadEval, a unified, open-source framework for evaluating
    radiology texts. RadEval consolidates a diverse range of metrics - from classic
    n‑gram overlap (BLEU, ROUGE) and contextual measures (BERTScore) to clinical concept-based
    scores (F1CheXbert, F1RadGraph, RaTEScore, SRR-BERT, TemporalEntityF1) and advanced
    LLM‑based evaluators (GREEN). We refine and standardize implementations, extend
    GREEN to support multiple imaging modalities with a more lightweight model, and
    pretrain a domain-specific radiology encoder - demonstrating strong zero-shot
    retrieval performance. We also release a richly annotated expert dataset with
    over 450 clinically significant error labels and show how different metrics correlate
    with radiologist judgment. Finally, RadEval provides statistical testing tools
    and baseline model evaluations across multiple publicly available datasets, facilitating
    reproducibility and robust benchmarking in radiology report generation.

    automation capabilities but are vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI)
    attacks. We show that adversaries can embed universal adversarial triggers in
    webpage HTML to hijack agents that utilize the parsed-HTML accessibility tree,
    causing unintended or malicious actions. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
    (GCG) algorithm and a Browser Gym agent powered by Llama-3.1, this work demonstrates
    high success rates across real websites in both targeted and general attacks,
    including login credential exfiltration and forced advertisement clicks. Our empirical
    results highlight critical security risks and the need for stronger defenses as
    LLM-driven autonomous web agents become more widely adopted. The system software
    is released under the MIT License at https://github.com/sej2020/manipulating-web-agents,
    with an accompanying publicly available demo website and video.

- abstract: "We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational\
    \ autoencoders (VAEs) \non top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such\
    \ language model VAEs can encode the knowledge \nof their pre-trained components\
    \ into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. \nThe representations\
    \ obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion framework: LangSpace,\
    \ \nwhich implements a collection of probing methods, such as vector traversal\
    \ and interpolation, disentanglement \nmeasures, and cluster visualisations. LangVAE\
    \ and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable way of \nbuilding and\
    \ analysing textual representations, with simple integration for models available\
    \ on the HuggingFace \nHub. Additionally, we conducted a set of experiments with\
    \ different encoder and decoder combinations, as well \nas annotated inputs, revealing\
    \ a wide range of interactions across architectural families and sizes w.r.t.\n\
    generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings demonstrate a promising framework\
    \ for systematising the experimentation and understanding of textual representations."

  title: 'LangVAE and LangSpace: Building and Probing for Language Model VAEs'
- abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
    especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly facilitated
    the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still facing challenges
    of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction with heterogeneous
    tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic
    and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by Google have been introduced,
    and to the best of our knowledge, very few applications exist where both protocols
    are employed within a single MAS framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster,
    a novel modular multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP,
    enabling dynamic coordination, flexible communication, and rapid development with
    faster iteration. Through a unified conversational interface, the system supports
    natural language interaction without prior technical expertise and responds to
    multimodal queries for tasks including information retrieval, question answering,
    and image analysis. The experiments are validated through both human evaluation
    and quantitative metrics, including BERTScore F1 (96.3%) and LLM-as-a-Judge G-Eval
    (87.1%). These results demonstrate robust automated inter-agent coordination,
    query decomposition, task allocation, dynamic routing, and domain-specific relevant
    responses. Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities
    of domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

  title: 'AgentMaster: A Multi-Agent Conversational Framework Using A2A and MCP Protocols
    for Multimodal Information Retrieval and Analysis'
- abstract: We present ROBoto2, an open-source, web-based platform for large language
    model (LLM)-assisted risk of bias (ROB) assessment of clinical trials. ROBoto2
    streamlines the traditionally labor-intensive ROB v2 (ROB2) annotation process
    via an interactive interface that combines PDF parsing, retrieval-augmented LLM
    prompting, and human-in-the-loop review. Users can upload clinical trial reports,
    receive preliminary answers and supporting evidence for ROB2 signaling questions,
    and provide real-time feedback or corrections to system suggestions. ROBoto2 is
    publicly available at https://roboto2.vercel.app/, with code and data released
    to foster reproducibility and adoption. We construct and release a dataset of
    521 pediatric clinical trial reports (8954 signaling questions with 1202 evidence
    passages), annotated using both manually and LLM-assisted methods, serving as
    a benchmark and enabling future research. Using this dataset, we benchmark ROB2
    performance for 4 LLMs and provide an analysis into current model capabilities
    and ongoing challenges in automating this critical aspect of systematic review.

  title: 'ROBOTO2: An Interactive System and Dataset for LLM-assisted Clinical Trial
    Risk of Bias Assessment'
- abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are advancing at an unprecedented pace globally,
    with regions increasingly adopting these models for applications in their primary
    languages. Evaluating these models in diverse linguistic environments, especially
    in low-resource languages, has become a major challenge for academia and industry.
    Existing evaluation frameworks suffer from inconsistency across different benchmarks,
    being disproportionately focused on English and a handful of high-resource languages,
    thereby overlooking the realistic performance of LLMs in multilingual and lower-resource
    scenarios. To address this critical challenge of fragmented and inconsistent multilingual
    evaluation, we introduce GlotEval, a unified and lightweight framework that systematically
    integrates 27 benchmarks under a standardized ISO 639-3 language identifier system,
    allowing for seamless incorporation of new benchmarks. Supporting nine key tasks
    (machine translation, text classification, summarization, open-ended generation,
    reading comprehension, sequence labeling, intrinsic evaluation, instruction following
    and reasoning), spanning over dozens to hundreds of languages, GlotEval uniquely
    enables language-specific, cross-benchmark analysis and non-English-centric evaluations
    at a scale previously less practical for many researchers. This enables a precise
    diagnosis of model strengths and weaknesses in diverse linguistic contexts. A
    multilingual translation case study demonstrates GlotEval's applicability for
    multilingual and language-specific evaluations.

  title: 'GlotEval: A Test Suite for Massively Multilingual Evaluation of Large Language
    Models'
- abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly used for planning
    in orchestrated multi-agent systems. However, existing LLM-based approaches often
    fall short of human expectations and, critically, lack effective mechanisms for
    users to inspect, understand, and control their behaviors. These limitations call
    for enhanced transparency, controllability, and human oversight. To address this,
    we introduce AIPOM, a system supporting human-in-the-loop planning through conversational
    and graph-based interfaces. AIPOM enables users to transparently inspect, refine,
    and collaboratively guide LLM-generated plans, significantly enhancing user control
    and trust in multi-agent workflows. Our code and demo video are available at https://github.com/megagonlabs/aipom.

  title: 'AIPOM: Agent-aware Interactive Planning for Multi-Agent Systems'
- abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt
    ClassificaTion), a novel mixed-initiative annotation framework that integrates
    human expertise with automatic annotation guided by large language models (LLMs).
    Co-DETECT starts with an initial, sketch-level codebook and dataset provided by
    a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and identify edge
    cases that are not well described by the initial codebook. Specifically, Co-DETECT
    flags challenging examples, induces high-level, generalizable descriptions of
    edge cases, and assists user in incorporating edge case handling rules to improve
    the codebook. This iterative process enables more effective handling of nuanced
    phenomena through compact, generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study,
    qualitative and quantitative analyses prove the effectiveness of Co-DETECT.

  title: 'Co-DETECT: Collaborative Discovery of Edge Cases in Text Classification'
- abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering
    has revealed critical limitations in existing benchmarks, particularly the widely
    used SWE-bench dataset. Recent studies have uncovered severe data contamination
    issues, e.g., SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches involve direct solution
    leakage and 31.08% pass due to inadequate test cases. We introduce SWE-MERA, a
    dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to address these fundamental
    challenges through an automated collection of real-world GitHub issues and rigorous
    quality validation. Our approach implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality
    while minimizing contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential
    tasks with 728 samples currently available. Evaluation using the Aider coding
    agent demonstrates strong discriminative power in state-of-the-art models. We
    report performance across a dozen recent LLMs evaluated on tasks collected between
    September 2024 and June 2025.

  title: 'SWE-MERA: A Dynamic Benchmark for Agenticly Evaluating Large Language Models
    on Software Engineering Tasks'
- abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents produce rich, multi-step trajectories
    that interleave observations, internal reasoning, and tool actions. However, most
    evaluation pipelines focus solely on end-task success, leaving the agent’s decision-making
    process opaque and poorly understood. We introduce AgentDiagnose, an open-source,
    modular framework for diagnosing agent trajectories. The present release fully
    supports the web domain, and AgentDiagnose is architect as an extensible, open
    platform with compatibility for most agent trajectories. AgentDiagnose consists
    of (i) an evaluation module that quantifies five core agentic competencies—backtracking
    & exploration, task decomposition, observation reading, self-verification, and
    objective quality—and (ii) a visualization module that highlights trajectory semantics
    through t-SNE action embeddings, interactive word clouds, and state-transition
    timelines. On a set of 30 manually annotated trajectories, our automatic metrics
    achieve a mean Pearson correlation of 0.57 with human judgments, rising to 0.78
    for task decomposition. Furthermore, filtering the 46k-example NNetNav-Live dataset
    with AgentDiagnose and fine-tuning a Llama-3.1-8B model on the top 6k trajectories
    improves WebArena success rates by 0.98, despite using only 13% of the original
    data. AgentDiagnose thus serves as both a diagnostic lens for agent analysis and
    a practical tool for curating higher-quality training data. The toolkit and demo
    are publicly available.

  title: 'BioGraphia: A LLM-Assisted Biological Pathway Graph Annotation Platform'
- abstract: 'We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking,
    analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the
    extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of open-source
    VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that abstracts
    away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation across diverse
    VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and their over 30 variants,
    and is extensible to accommodate new models without changing the core logic.


    The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis methods.
    We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments, revealing systematic
    differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across layers and target concepts.
    VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to accelerate community efforts
    in understanding and improving VLMs.'

  title: 'From Behavioral Performance to Internal Competence: Interpreting Vision-Language
    Models with VLM-Lens'
- abstract: 'The learning process for medical residents presents significant challenges,
    demanding both the ability to interpret complex case reports and the rapid acquisition
    of accurate medical knowledge from reliable sources. Residents typically study
    case reports and engage in discussions with peers and mentors, but finding relevant
    educational materials and evidence to support their learning from these cases
    is often time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we introduce MedTutor,
    a novel system designed to augment resident training by automatically generating
    evidence-based educational content and multiple-choice questions from clinical
    case reports. MedTutor leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
    that takes clinical case reports as input and produces targeted educational materials.
    The system''s architecture features a hybrid retrieval mechanism that synergistically
    queries a local knowledge base of medical textbooks and academic literature (using
    PubMed, Semantic Scholar APIs) for latest related research, ensuring the generated
    content is both foundationally sound and current. The retrieved evidence is filtered
    and ordered using a state-of-the-art reranking model and then an LLM generates
    the final long-form output describing the main educational content regarding the
    case-report.

    We conduct a rigorous evaluation of the system. First, two radiologists assessed
    the quality of outputs, finding them to be of high clinical and educational value.
    Second, we perform a large-scale evaluation using an LLM-as-a Judge to understand
    if LLMs can be used to evaluate the output of the system. Our analysis using correlation
    of LLMs with human expert judgments  reveals a moderate alignment and highlights
    the continued necessity of expert oversight.'

  title: 'MedTutor: A Retrieval-Augmented LLM System for Case-Based Medical Education'
- abstract: 'Large language model agents have enabled GUI-based automation, particularly
    for mobile devices. However, deployment remains limited by noisy data, poor generalization,
    and lack of support for non-English GUIs. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI,
    an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction.
    Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception,
    supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate
    human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning
    capability. AgentCPM-GUI achieves promising performance on five public benchmarks
    and our proposed Chinese benchmark CAGUI. To facilitate reproducibility and further
    research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data

  title: 'AgentCPM-GUI: Building Mobile-Use Agents with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning'
- abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent agents
    has underscored the necessity for robust evaluation frameworks capable of assessing
    agent performance in realistic, interactive environments. Existing evaluation
    methodologies often suffer from limitations such as static task benchmarks, limited
    scope, and inadequate integration with practical applications. In response, we
    introduce MCPEval, an open-source, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-based evaluation
    framework specifically tailored for comprehensive and systematic assessment of
    LLM-powered agents. MCPEval standardizes evaluations across diverse domains through
    automated task generation and verification, supports multiple performance metrics,
    and integrates seamlessly with native agent capabilities. We empirically validate
    the effectiveness of MCPEval across five distinct real-world domains, highlighting
    significant variations in performance across various LLM architectures and prompting
    strategies. Our results illustrate the framework’s capacity to uncover nuanced
    performance patterns and identify domain-specific strengths and weaknesses, providing
    valuable insights beyond traditional binary success metrics. We publicly release
    MCPEval to foster reproducible research and promote standardized evaluation practices
    within the LLM agent community.

  title: 'MCPEval: Automatic MCP-based Deep Evaluation for AI Agent Models'
- abstract: 'Evaluating LLMs with a single prompt has proven unreliable, with small
    changes leading to significant performance differences. However, generating the
    prompt variations needed for a more robust multi-prompt evaluation is challenging,
    limiting its adoption in practice. To address this, we introduce PromptSuite,
    a framework that enables the automatic generation of various prompts. PromptSuite
    is flexible – working out of the box on a wide range of tasks and benchmarks.
    It follows a modular prompt design, allowing controlled perturbations to each
    component, and is extensible, supporting the addition of new components and perturbation
    types. Through a series of case studies, we show that PromptSuite provides meaningful
    variations to support strong evaluation practices. All resources, including the
    Python API, source code, user-friendly web interface, and demonstration video,
    are available at: https://eliyahabba.github.io/PromptSuite/.'

  title: 'PromptSuite: A Task-Agnostic Framework for Multi-Prompt Generation'
- abstract: 'LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
    results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with greater
    efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In this paper,
    we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for multimodal input.
    Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove leverages visual and contextual
    background information to enhance the translation process. Additionally, we integrate
    a multimodal memory system and long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific
    knowledge, enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
    scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation quality
    in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28\% improvement
    in BLEU scores and a 15\% improvement in SubER compared to previous state-of-the-art
    baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark for long-form automatic
    video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of high-quality, human-annotated
    data. Our demo is available here: https://vidove.willbe03.com/'

  title: 'ViDove: A Translation Agent System with Multimodal Context and Memory-Augmented
    Reasoning'
- abstract: "Scientific research often requires constructing high-quality datasets,\
    \ yet the current workflows remain labor-intensive,  and dependent on domain expertise.\
    \ Existing approaches automate isolated steps such as retrieval or generation,\
    \ but lack support for the full end-to-end data collection process. We present\
    \ Quest2DataAgent, a general-purpose multi-agent framework for automating scientific\
    \ data collection workflows. Given a natural language research question, it decomposes\
    \ tasks into structured subtasks, retrieves relevant data using hybrid strategies,\
    \ evaluates dataset quality, and generates visualizations through a conversational\
    \ interface. \nWe demonstrate its flexibility in two domains: EcoData for ecological\
    \ research and PolyData for polymer materials. Both systems share the same core\
    \ architecture but operate over distinct datasets and user needs. Human evaluations\
    \ show that Quest2DataAgent significantly improves data relevance, usability,\
    \ and time efficiency compared to manual collection and tool-assisted baselines.\
    \ The framework is open-source and extensible to other domains."

  title: 'Quest2DataAgent: Automating End-to-End Scientific Data Collection'
- abstract: We present Marcel, a lightweight and open-source conversational agent
    designed to support prospective students with admission-related inquiries. The
    system aims to provide fast and personalized responses, while reducing workload
    of university staff. We employ retrieval-augmented generation to ground answers
    in university resources and to provide users with verifiable, contextually relevant
    information. We introduce a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) retriever that maps
    user questions to knowledge-base entries, which allows administrators to steer
    retrieval, and improves over standard dense/hybrid retrieval strategies. The system
    is engineered for easy deployment in resource-constrained academic settings. We
    detail the system architecture, provide a technical evaluation of its components,
    and report insights from a real-world deployment.

  title: 'Marcel: A Lightweight and Open-Source Conversational Agent for University
    Student Support'
- abstract: Despite Bengali being the sixth most spoken language in the world, handwritten
    text recognition (HTR) systems for Bengali remain severely underdeveloped. The
    complexity of Bengali script—featuring conjuncts, diacritics, and highly variable
    handwriting styles—combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets makes this task
    particularly challenging. We present **GraDeT-HTR**, a resource-efficient Bengali
    handwritten text recognition system based on a **Gra**pheme-aware **De**coder-only
    **T**ransformer architecture. To address the unique challenges of Bengali script,
    we augment the performance of a decoder-only transformer by integrating a grapheme-based
    tokenizer and demonstrate that it significantly improves recognition accuracy
    compared to conventional subword tokenizers. Our model is pretrained on large-scale
    synthetic data and fine-tuned on real human-annotated samples, achieving state-of-the-art
    performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

- abstract: 'Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive
    for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates
    personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises
    three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning
    errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked
    memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance
    and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation
    and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering
    scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.'

  title: 'LearnLens: LLM-Enabled Personalised, Curriculum-Grounded Feedback with Educators
    in the Loop'
- abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning and text generation
    capabilities, prompting their use in scientific literature analysis, including
    novelty assessment. While evaluating novelty of scientific papers is crucial for
    peer review, it requires extensive knowledge of related work, something not all
    reviewers have.While recent work on LLM-assisted scientific literature analysis
    supports literature comparison, existing approaches offer limited transparency
    and lack mechanisms for result traceability via an information retrieval module.
    To address this gap, we introduce GraphMind, an easy-to-use interactive web tool
    designed to assist users in evaluating the novelty of scientific papers or drafted
    ideas. Specially, GraphMind enables users to capture the main structure of a scientific
    paper, explore related ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty
    via providing verifiable contextual insights. GraphMind enables users to annotate
    key elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships,
    and assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs
    such as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction,
    retrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a
    rich, structured view of a scientific idea's core contributions and its connections
    to existing work. GraphMind is available at https://oyarsa.github.io/graphmind
    and a demonstration video at https://youtu.be/wKbjQpSvwJg.

  title: 'GraphMind: Interactive Novelty Assessment System for Accelerating Scientific
    Discovery'
- abstract: 'High-quality schematic diagrams, which provide a conceptual overview
    of the research, play a crucial role in summarizing and clarifying a study’s core
    ideas. However, creating these diagrams is time-consuming for authors and remains
    challenging for current AI systems, as it requires both a deep understanding of
    the paper’s content and a strong sense of visual design. To address this, we introduce
    SCISKETCH, an open-source framework that supports two automated workflows for
    schematic diagram generation using foundation models, shown in Figure 1. 1) In
    the graphic-code-based workflow, SCISKETCH follows a two-stage pipeline: it first
    produces a layout plan expressed in a graphical code language with a self-refinement
    and self-verification mechanism. It then integrates empirical images and symbolic
    icons to create a visually coherent, informative diagram. 2) In the image-based
    workflow, SCISKETCH directly synthesizes the diagram image through image generation
    with a self-refinement mechanism. Through both automatic and human evaluations,
    we show that SCISKETCH outperforms several state-of-the-art foundation models,
    including GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, in generating schematic diagrams for scientific
    papers. We make SCISKETCH fully open-sourced, providing researchers with an accessible,
    extensible tool for high-quality schematic diagram generation in scientific fields.'

  title: 'SciSketch: An Open-source Framework for Automated Schematic Diagram Generation
    in Scientific Papers'
- abstract: One of the most important tasks in quantitative investment research is
    mining new alphas (effective trading signals or factors). Traditional alpha mining
    methods, either hand-crafted factor synthesis or algorithmic factor mining (e.g.,
    search with genetic programming), have inherent limitations, especially in implementing
    the ideas of quant researchers. In this work, we propose a new alpha mining paradigm
    by introducing human-AI interaction, and a novel prompt engineering algorithmic
    framework to implement this paradigm by leveraging the power of large language
    models. Moreover, we develop Alpha-GPT, a new interactive alpha mining system
    framework that provides a heuristic way to ``understand'' the ideas of quant researchers
    and outputs creative, insightful, and effective alphas. We demonstrate the effectiveness
    and advantage of Alpha-GPT via a number of alpha mining experiments. In particular,
    we evaluated Alpha-GPT's performance in the \textbf{WorldQuant International Quant
    Championship}, where it demonstrated results comparable to those of top-performing
    human participants, ranking among \textbf{top-10} over 41000 teams worldwide.
    These findings suggest Alpha-GPT's significant potential in generating highly
    effective alphas that may surpass human capabilities in quantitative investment
    strategies.

  title: 'Alpha-GPT: Human-AI Interactive Alpha Mining for Quantitative Investment'
- abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized
    NLP domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
    transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable systems
    in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation methods and
    evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the challenge of selecting
    optimal explainability approaches, we present o-mega, a hyperparameter optimization
    tool designed to automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods
    and their configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega
    on a post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
    paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different explainable
    methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved transparency in automated
    fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated optimization of explanation
    methods can significantly enhance the interpretability of claim-matching models
    in critical applications such as misinformation detection, contributing to more
    trustworthy and transparent AI systems.

  title: 'o-MEGA: Optimized Methods for Explanation Generation and Analysis'
- abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
    optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to instabilities
    or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce Interactive Training,
    an open-source framework that enables real-time, feedback-driven intervention
    during neural network training by human experts or automated AI agents. At its
    core, Interactive Training uses a control server to mediate communication between
    users or agents and the ongoing training process, allowing users to dynamically
    adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data, and model checkpoints. Through
    three case studies, we demonstrate that Interactive Training achieves superior
    training stability, reduced sensitivity to initial hyperparameters, and improved
    adaptability to evolving user needs, paving the way toward a future training paradigm
    where AI agents autonomously monitor training logs, proactively resolves instabilities,
    and optimizes training dynamics.

  title: 'Interactive Training: Feedback-Driven Neural Network Optimization'
- abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication,
    due to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
    generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful empathetic
    LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture,
    data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent
    research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source,
    transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions.
    Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs
    a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation.
    To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
    pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
    low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and
    controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation,
    we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and
    minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including
    the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the
    broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

  title: 'OpenS2S: Advancing Fully Open-Source End-to-End Empathetic Large Speech
    Language Model'
- abstract: Automatic research with Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly gaining
    importance, driving the development of increasingly complex workflows involving
    multi-agent systems, planning, tool usage, code execution, and human-agent interaction
    to accelerate research processes. However, as more researchers and developers
    begin to use and build upon these tools and platforms, the complexity and difficulty
    of extending and maintaining such agentic workflows have become a significant
    challenge, particularly as algorithms and architectures continue to advance. To
    address this growing complexity, TinyScientist identifies the essential components
    of the automatic research workflow and proposes an interactive, extensible, and
    controllable framework that adapts easily to new tools and supports iterative
    growth. We provide an open-source codebase, an interactive web demonstration,
    and a PyPI Python package to make state-of-the-art auto-research pipelines broadly
    accessible to every researcher and developer.

  title: 'TinyScientist: An Interactive, Extensible, and Controllable Framework for
    Building Research Agents'
- abstract: The ARR Responsible NLP Research checklist website states that the "checklist
    is designed to encourage best practices for responsible research, addressing issues
    of research ethics, societal impact and reproducibility." Answering the questions
    is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared
    scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering a checklist before
    submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, previous
    research has shown that self-reported checklist responses don't always accurately
    represent papers. In this work, we introduce ConfReady, a retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on
    their work and assist authors with conference checklists. To evaluate checklist
    assistants, we curate a dataset of 1,975 ACL checklist responses, analyze problems
    in human answers, and benchmark RAG and Large Language Model (LM) based systems
    on an evaluation subset. Our code is released under the AGPL-3.0 license on GitHub,
    with documentation covering the user interface and PyPI package.

  title: 'ConfReady: A RAG based Assistant and Dataset for Conference Checklist Responses'
- abstract: We introduce LLM$\times$MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
    designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2,
    this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where individual functional
    components, such as skeleton initialization, digest construction, and skeleton
    refinement, are implemented as independent model-context-protocol (MCP) servers.
    These atomic servers can be aggregated into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically
    structured system. A high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow
    by selecting appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the
    execution history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
    affording users greater control and customization over the research process. Through
    a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended research
    perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then developed into
    an in-depth survey. \highlight{Human evaluations demonstrate that our system surpasses
    representative baselines in both content depth and length}, highlighting the strength
    of MCP-based modular planning. Demo, video and code are available at \url{https://github.com/thunlp/LLMxMapReduce}.

  title: 'LLM$\times$MapReduce-V3: Enabling Interactive In-Depth Survey Generation
    through a MCP-Driven Hierarchically Modular Agent System'
- abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize
    to novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling diverse
    token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to address
    this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack of support
    for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome these issues,
    we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework designed for training,
    evaluation, and visualization of dynamic vocabulary-augmented language models.
    Our framework modularizes the pipeline for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly
    with open-source LLMs, and is the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for
    real-time result inspection. We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary
    methods on modern LLMs and demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly
    improving inference throughput.

  title: 'DVAGen: Dynamic Vocabulary Augmented Generation'
- abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has democratized access to powerful
    tools such as Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, to generate high-quality images,
    users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and context—often
    through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor, a novel multi-agent
    framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization process. Our system
    decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work collaboratively to
    transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive, refined prompt. By
    leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, our framework effectively infers
    hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To iteratively refine
    the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified prompt with the original
    input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user feedback for further refinement.
    Experimental results demonstrate that PromptSculptor significantly enhances output
    quality and reduces the number of iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover,
    its model-agnostic design allows seamless integration with various T2I models,
    paving the way for industrial applications.

  title: 'PromptSculptor: Multi-Agent Based Text-to-Image Prompt Optimization'
- abstract: We demonstrate Metamo, a browser-based dialogue system that transforms
    an off-the-shelf large language model into an empathetic coach for everyday workplace
    concerns. Metamo introduces a light, single-pass wrapper that first identifies
    the cognitive distortion behind an emotion, then recognizes the user’s emotion,
    and finally produces a question-centered reply that invites reflection, all within
    one model call. The wrapper keeps the response time below two seconds in the API,
    yet enriches the feedback with cognitively grounded insight. A front-end web interface
    renders the detected emotion as an animated avatar and shows distortion badges
    in real time, whereas a safety layer blocks medical advice and redirects crisis
    language to human hotlines. Empirical tests on public corpora confirmed that the
    proposed design improved emotion‑recognition quality and response diversity without
    sacrificing latency. A small user study with company staff reported higher perceived
    empathy and usability than a latency‑matched baseline. Metamo is model-agnostic,
    illustrating a practical path toward cognition-aware coaching tools.

  title: 'Metamo: Empowering Large Language Models with Psychological Distortion Detection
    for Cognition-aware Coaching'
- abstract: 'The rapid adoption of LLM-based conversational systems is already transforming
    the landscape of educational technology. However, the current state-of-the-art
    learning models do not take into account the student’s affective states. Multiple
    studies in educational psychology support the claim that positive or negative
    emotional states can impact a student’s learning capabilities. To bridge this
    gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware LLM-powered Math Tutor, which
    dynamically models the student’s emotions and maps them to relevant pedagogical
    strategies, making the tutor-student conversation a more empathetic one. The student’s
    emotions are captured from the conversational text as well as from their facial
    expressions. The student’s emotions are aggregate from both modalities to confidently
    prompt our LLM Tutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have evaluated our
    model using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions and
    user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win rate
    and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly supports
    our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor’s pedagogical abilities by modeling
    students’ emotions. Our dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/ITU-NLP/MathBuddy.'
