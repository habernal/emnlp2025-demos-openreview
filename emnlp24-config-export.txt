Accept Email Content: Dear {{fullname}},

Thank you for submitting your paper, {{submission_title}}, to EMNLP24 Demo Track. We are delighted to inform you that your submission has been accepted. This year, with the introduction of new requirements for links of live demos and video demos, the quality, the completeness, and competitiveness of submissions have significantly increased. Congratulations!

Please find the final reviews for your paper on the submission page in OpenReview at: {{forum_url}}

Please prepare the camera ready following the ACL main conference. Due to the delay in the notifications, we will extend the camera ready deadline to October 20 11:59pm anywhere on earth. To upload a camera-ready version of your paper, simply go to your paper forum and click on the Edit button. The submissions instructions are the same as EMNLP main conference, with only difference in the page limits: final version of demo paper will be given one additional page of content (up to 7 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. We do not have any length constraints for the Appendix in the final version.

The final version should follow the EMNLP 2024 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded in Style Files and Formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions.

[Verification] To guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the ACL Pubcheck tool (https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck). The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission. Please reach out to emnlp2024-demo-track@googlegroups.com if you have any questions.

Best,
EMNLP24 Demo Program Chairs
